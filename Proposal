                  A Web based Covert File System

Overview:
This project implements a web based covert FUSE filesystem (CovertFS) for users to backup, store and share their files in Flickr images without the knowledge of their service providers. This project is being developed as required by COSC 5399.  

Functionality:
1)	User has to create a valid account in Flickr.
2)	To access the hidden file system in Flickr, a user has to mount it at a desired mount point in the local file system.
		a.	During the mount, provide proper authorization details- Flickr url, account name and password for the account where users file system is hosted.
		b.	The passphrase for encryption/decryption of the file system contents.
3)	Verify authorization details and mount the file system.
4)	Store photos containing the hidden file system metadata in a local image cache.

Technical Specifications:
