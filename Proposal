                  A Web based Covert File System

Overview:
This project implements a web based covert filesystem (CovertFS) for users to backup, store and share their files in Flickr images. The files are viewed and accessed on local machine using File System in User Space (FUSE). This project is being developed as required by COSC 5399.  

Functionality:
1)	User has to create a valid account in Flickr.
2)	To access the hidden file system in Flickr, a user has to mount it at a desired mount point as a FUSE file system in the local machine.
		a.	During the mount, provide proper authorization details- Flickr url, account name and password for the account where covert file system is hosted.
3)	Verify authorization details and mount the file system.


Technical Specifications:
Implementation
Programming Language: Python
OS: Linux
Version Control: Git

Milestones:
1.	FUSE Module
	Write a program passthrough.py which would replicate covert filesystem on Flickr to local mountpoint.

2.	Steganography Implementation
	Use LSB (or any other algorithm) algorithm to store the information inside images in Flickr (https://www.flickr.com/)
